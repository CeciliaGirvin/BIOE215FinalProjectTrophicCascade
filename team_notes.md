# Replicating "Behavioral responses across a mosaic of ecosystem states restructure a sea otter-urchin trophic cascade" by Smith *et al*, 2021.

Team members: Nikka Malakooti, Andrea Paz-Lacavex, Maddie Mcnelis, Cecilia Girvin.

This document is our Final Project for BIOE215 Data Science. This activity has the objective of applying lerned techniques to set up a computational analysis (using RStudio, git, and GitHub) and techniques for analyzing data (creating and accessing data structures, writing functions, and using the tidyverse). We hav applied those skills to replicate a key finding (e.g., a figure or table) from a published paper.

The paper selected has the following citation: Smith, J. G., Tomoleoni, J., Staedler, M., Lyon, S., Fujii, J., & Tinker, M. T. (2021). Behavioral responses across a mosaic of ecosystem states restructure a sea otter--urchin trophic cascade. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *118*(11), e2012493118.

Figures we intend to replicate are: Figure 2 (a and b).

Andrea will be the Repository Maintainer in the following GitHub Repository: <https://github.com/andreapazlacavex/BIOE215FinalProjectTrophicCascade>
