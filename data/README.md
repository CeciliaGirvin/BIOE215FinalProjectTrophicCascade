To replicate Smith *et al,* 2021 Figure 2a and 2b (see above), we need the following data:

| Kelp stipe density  | Proportion of exposed urchins | Mean urchin gonad index |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| (no.stipes/m2)      | (per m2)                      | (per m2)                |

This data can be found in data/raw_data/Smith_2017-19_benthic_data.csv

#### Key findings

-   Figure 2a. The proportion of exposed urchins was greatest in areas with no kelp, and crevice occupancy increase with increasing kelp density to the point where most individuals were concealed. The asymptotic projection of the model indicated that most urchins were concealed where the mean kelp stipe density was greater than one stipe per square meter.

-   Figure 2b. Gonad index declines with increasing urchin exposure. Also, gonad index was greatest in areas with high kelp density, where urchins were mainly occupying crevices, but gonad index declined linearly with increasing urchin exposure.
